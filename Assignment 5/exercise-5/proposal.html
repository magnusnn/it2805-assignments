                Our primary goal is to create a game developer web site, showcasing our product line of games or game concepts that we have made during our studies here at NTNU.

            <h3> Potential audience </h3>
            <p>
                Our potential audience is PC-gamers across the world. These are usually tech savvy people, so we can assume that our audience have updated web browsers. We also assume that they would want to access our pages on the go, so support for smaller screens is important.

        <section>
            <h3> Multi-media content </h3>
            <p>
                We plan to include screenshots and videos of the games. Videos will probably be embedded from youtube since we do not have the storage space to host them ourselves.
            </p>

        <section>
            <h3> Interactions and dynamic features </h3>
            <p>
                Ideally all content should be stored in a database allowing for some form of CMS. Also we would like to have some kind of community / support forum on our site.
            </p>

        <section>
            <h3> Content origin </h3>
            <p>
                All primary content will be content that we have created ourselves or were central participants in the creation of. This primary content may contain resources with unknown origin. Other resources like icons, visual details etc. will be from freely available sources.
            </p>

            <h3> Similar sites observations </h3>
            <p>
                Put the games in focus.
            </p>
            <p>
                If we want to use background images, it is very important to consider the color combination between the image and text, so that the text is clearly readable.
            </p>
            <p>
                Do not clutter the user with too much information right away, but give a simple intro / showcase at the home page and then direct the user to their interests.
